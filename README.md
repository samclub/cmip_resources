CMIP6 data is freely accessible on the [Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/noaa-public/cmip6). It is maintained by the Climate Data Science Lab at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University, as part of the [Pangeo Project](https://pangeo.io/).

Python Users can assess the data using [intake-esm](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, the existing catalogs
provided by [NCAR Intake-esm Datastore](https://github.com/NCAR/intake-esm-datastore) is not lastest. Therefore, I updated the   catalogs here in [cmip_google](https://github.com/samclub/cmip_resources/tree/master/cmip_google).
